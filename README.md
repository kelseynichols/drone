# Hovr

During my time as a fullstack development student at the coding bootcamp, Depot/U - I joined with two other group members to create our two week capstone project, Hovr.

The idea behind Hovr is to use drones to view progress on constructions sites.

Contractors can log in, "create" their building, design a route, and fly a drone to view progress.

Our project was built using AngularJS, Node/Express.js, and mySQL.
